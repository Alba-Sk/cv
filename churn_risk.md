### Project:  Churn reduction strategy
### *Project Overview*  

The telecom company aims to predict and prevent customer churn by leveraging customer data across multiple services, including landline, internet, security, tech support, and streaming. The projectâ€™s goal is to reduce churn rates through targeted promotions and special offers, enhancing customer retention.  

The project involves analyzing customer behavior, segmenting churn-prone clients, and crafting personalized retention strategies based on model predictions. The model also informs resource allocation and service improvements to optimize the customer experience.  

### 2. *Model Development*  
The churn prediction model was trained using customer data, including contract details, service usage patterns, and demographic information. A classification model was chosen to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., terminate services) or remain with the telecom company.  

Data Preprocessing:    
Data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.  
Feature selection to retain the most impactful predictors of churn.  

Model Selection:  
The model was trained using CatBoost due to its ability to handle categorical features and deliver high performance.
The model was validated using cross-validation techniques and tuned for optimal performance using hyperparameter tuning.

Training:
The model was trained for a sufficient number of epochs to ensure convergence and improvement in prediction accuracy.  
```javascript
# Prepare the Pool for training and validation
train_pool = Pool(features_resample, target_resample)
valid_pool = Pool(features_valid, target_valid)

# Define parameters for the CatBoost model (using params_cv defined earlier)
params_cv = {
    'iterations': 2000,
    'depth': 6,
    'learning_rate': 0.03,
    'l2_leaf_reg': 5,
    'loss_function': 'Logloss',
    'eval_metric': 'AUC',
    'random_seed': 42,
    'verbose': 0
}
# Train final model on the resampled dataset with evaluation set
final_model = CatBoostClassifier(**params_cv)

```

### 3. *Results*  
The model's performance metrics were evaluated to gauge its effectiveness in identifying churners and non-churners:  

ROC AUC: 93.33%    
This indicates excellent model performance, with the ability to distinguish churn clients from active clients effectively. The high ROC AUC suggests minimal false positives and negatives.

Accuracy: 88.20%  
The model correctly predicted churn or non-churn in about 88.20% of cases, demonstrating overall correctness.  

Precision: 75.74%  
The model predicts with a precision of 75.74%, meaning that 75.74% of the time, when the model predicts a customer will churn, it is correct. This helps reduce false positives, ensuring marketing resources are not wasted on clients who aren't likely to churn.  

Recall: 81.82%  
The model identifies 81.82% of actual churn clients. This high recall ensures that most churn-prone clients are correctly targeted for retention strategies.  

F1 Score: 78.66%  
The F1 score balances precision and recall, reflecting a reasonable trade-off between identifying churn clients and avoiding false positives.

### 4. *Business Recommendation*
The recommandation and Insights for the Telecom business as follow:  
1) <font color='blue'> Targeted Retention strategies </font> : - With hight score of recall 81.82% focus on developing targeted retention strategies for the clients predicted to churn. This could involve personalized offers, discounts, or reach in other services which the client doesnt access yet.  
2) <font color='blue'> Optimize resouce allocation </font> : - With precision 75.74% ensure that marketing and customer service are allocated effectivly. Focus efforts on clients predicted to churn while also maintaing the strategy to minimize engagement with the client which not  are a risk for churn.  
3) <font color='blue'> Customer Feedback </font> : Establish mechanisms to gather feedback from the clients who have churned to identify common pain points. This information improvements in service or products offering for the pottential churn client.  
3) <font color='blue'> Model monitoring </font> : Implementing a system  for ongoing monitoring  of the models over time because the clients behavior it changes and the date need to be realistically on time.
